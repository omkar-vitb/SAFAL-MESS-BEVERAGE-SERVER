PROBLEM STATEMENT: In my safal mess beverages are served every evening manually to students.This leads to several issue that i see in my mess:
                   1.Inconsistent serving quantity
                   2.Delay during rush hours.
                   3.Difficult in tracking remaining beverages quantity.
                   4.Manual effort required for refilling and monitoring.

                   TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES , THIS PROJECT SIMULATES AN AUTOMATED BEVERAGE SERVER MACHINE.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT: This project cover--
                      1.Input of initial beverage quantities
                      2.Serving beverages automatically 
                      3.verification of student mess allotment (this simulates the face verification process that we go through for verification in the mess)
                      4.check if the beverage is available every time before serving
                      5. deduct 120 ml of beverage after each serve.
                      6.refilling beverage storage 
                      7.reporting remaining quantites.
                      8. turn the machine off when staff asks for it.
                      **HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION AND REAL SENSORS ARE NOT INCLUDED BUT THIS PROGRAM SIMULATES THE COMPLETE LOGIC**

TARGET USERS:    1.**HOSTEL MESS/MESS**They use the system to fill beverage, refill beverages, check remainingn quantity and turn it off when not in use.
                 2.**CAFETERIAS/RESTAURANTS**The same system can be used by different restaurants across globe which serves beverages. they can replace human intervention with this automated machine .
                 3.**Developers** developers can use this for learning the logic behind the automated machine.
                 4.**FOR PERSONAL USE**: people can also use it for personal use by automating their machine . this could be best used in a joint family. this can be commercialized .

                
HIGH LEVEL FEATURES: 1.**Initial bevearge setup** staff can enter the amount of milk ,coffee and tea in whatever amount they want to store in machine
                     2.**Student verification**this machine simulates the face verifying machine to ensure if student belong to safal mess or not.
                     3.**Drink selection** student can choose their favourite drink from milk,coffee and tea.
                     4.**Automatic resource deduction** the machine automaticall decrese 120 ml of chosen drink from the remaing quantity after each serve.
                     5.**refill system** staff memebers can refill beverages that will get added to the remaining quantity in the machine.
                     6.**Reporting system** this machine also shows the remaining quantity in the machine at any time.
                     7.**turning off**The system will turn off when mess staff will chose to turn it off when the machine is not in use.
